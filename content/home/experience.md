  Working in Medical Genomics group with Mark Ross and David Bentley
  
  Principal research:
  
  * Integrating RNA-seq expression data with clinical cancer genome analysis
  * Benchmarking sensitivity of variant detection for targeted cancer panels and comparing their performance to cWGS
  * Developing a method for estimation of tumour content in a sample from transcriptome data

  * Supervised by Boris Lenhard
  * PhD student aiming to understand spatio-temporal gene expression during zebrafish embryogenesis 
  * Thorough reanalysis of of all publicly available mRNAin situhybridisation data from zebrafish development led us to develop Anatom-ical specificity coefficient that tells about relative size of anatomical structures
  * Elucidated the role of core promoters in regulation and gene function that is a foundation to PromoterOntology methodology
  * Integrating numerous NGS datasets (RNA-seq, CAGE, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and scRNA-seq) with goal to understand how multiple layersof gene regulation communicate together to create final gene expression profiles. This process is crucial for early embryonic devel-opment.
