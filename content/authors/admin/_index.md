Hello there, thanks for stopping by :)


I have recently obtained a PhD in bioinformatics from Imperial College London. During that time, I was Marie Curie Early stage Researcher at London Instutute of Medical Sciences where I investigated gene expression regulation during embryonic development in zebrafish. 

To keep up with the current methods in Data Analysis and Genomics, I plan to do some smaller scale analysis projects that I will write about here.
